# GHuPrintGen. Generate a microprint of the logs of a workflow job

The action generates a highly microprint of the logs generated by a job inside a Github workflow.

If the job hasn't finished yet, the logs won't be complete. So it's recommended to create an extra job for generating and committing the generated microprints.

## Usage

```
name: Generate microprint of job

on: 
  push:

jobs:
  work_to_be_logged:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      {Your job steps}

  generate_microprint_of_first_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # If the job doesn't finish first, the logs won't be complete.
    needs: work_to_be_logged

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Get microprint of jobs logs
        uses: AlphaSteam/GHuPrintGen@v5
        with: # None of the inputs are required (though some are really recommended)

            # ====================================================================================
            # Github inputs

            # You can generate microprints of jobs on another repository if needed. By default it expects the job to be on the same repository.
            #
            # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
            
            repository: 

            # Job that's going to get used for microprint generation. By default it uses the job where the action is called. Not recommended as 
            # the logs don't get generated by the GitHub API until the job has finished all it's steps.
            #
            # Default: ${{ github.job }} (Not recommended!)

            # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the logs of the requested job. If the repo is public, it needs the public-repo scope,

## Microprint generation

The microprint generation is done by the package [uPrintGen](https://github.com/AlphaSteam/uPrintGen).

### Configuration file

The configuration file is a JSON file that follows the rules specified by uPrintGen. Those are [here](https://github.com/AlphaSteam/uPrintGen#configuration-file).
