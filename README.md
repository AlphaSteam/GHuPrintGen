# Generate a microprint of the logs of a workflow job

The action generates a highly microprint of the logs generated by a job inside a Github workflow.

If the job hasn't finished yet, the logs won't be complete. So it's recommended to create an extra job for generating and committing the generated microprints.

## Usage

```
name: Generate microprint of job

on: 
  push:

jobs:
  work_to_be_logged:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      {Your job steps}

  generate_microprint_of_first_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # If the job doesn't finish first, the logs won't be complete.
    needs: work_to_be_logged

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Get microprint of jobs logs
        uses: AlphaSteam/microprint-generator@v3
        with: # None of the inputs are required (though some are really recommended)

            # ====================================================================================

            # You can generate microprints of jobs on another repository if needed. By default it expects the job to be on the same repository.

            repository: 

            # Job that's going to get used for microprint generation. By default it uses the job where the action is called. Not recommended as 
            # the logs don't get generated by the GitHub API until the job has finished all it's steps.
            #
            # Default: ${{ github.job }} (Not recommended!)

## Microprint rules

There needs to be a set of rules to generate the microprints. These dictate what gets highlighted in the log and with what color. For that, there has to be a configuration JSON file in the repo. (By default in the root directory and with the name config.json).

The configuration file is optional and all the sections inside of it are optional too. (Without the configuration file, the microprint will be a render of the log without any highlight).

Here's an example with all the configurations that it can control (comments added for explanation purposes, not valid JSON):

For a valid example [click here](Examples/Mid-job/config.json)

```
{
  # Changes the scale of the font in the generated microprint.
  # Default: 1
  "scale": 2,

  # Changes the vertical spacing between each row.
  # Default: 1
  "vertical_spacing": 1.4,

  # Changes the width of the microprint (or each column if there's more than one)
  # Default: 120
  "microprint_width": 140,

  # Changes the max height of the microprint
  # If "number_of_columns" is set, this parameter is not used.
  # The microprint will be divided in columns to fulfill the desired height.
  # Default: Total log height. No limit
  "max_microprint_height": 300,

  # Changes the number of columns to render.
  # If this parameter is set, "max_microprint_height" is not used.
  # The height of the microprint will be set automatically to fulfill the desired number of columns
  # Default: Total log height. No limit
  "number_of_columns": 4,

  # Changes the size of the gap between columns
  # Default: 0.2
  "column_gap_size": 0.3,

  # Changes the color of the gap between columns
  # Default: "white"
  "column_gap_color": "red",

  # These define the default colors that are used in case no color was defined for
  # a certain rule. If this section is not present, both colors will be the

  # Each key corresponds to the word it needs to have in a row to use those
  # colors.
  
  # For example, if the key is "error" and the row contains the
  # word "error", then the whole row will be colored with the rules inside the
  # object

  # If any of the two colors is not set (text or background), the default ones 
  # are used.
